- üé® **Vibe Templates** - Ready-to-use configurations for different tech stacks
- üîÑ **Pattern Propagation** - Apply vibe patterns to new and existing repositories
- üì± **Menu Mode** - Guided setup for vibe-coding workflows
- ü§ñ **MCP Support** - Model Context Protocol server for AI integration
- üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible** - Create custom vibe patterns for your team

## Platform Support

Currently, **macOS is the only officially tested and supported platform**, with universal binaries available for both arm64 and amd64 architectures. 

We cross-compile to Linux distributions, but full testing and support is not yet complete. Windows support is technically possible but not currently on the short-term roadmap unless highly requested by the community.

## Installation

### Recommended (macOS)

For the fastest installation on macOS, first ensure you have `cargo-binstall`:

```bash
brew install cargo-binstall
```

Then install vibe-workspace:

```bash
cargo binstall vibe-workspace
```

### From Cargo (Build from Source)

```bash
cargo install vibe-workspace
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toolprint/vibe-workspace
cd vibe-workspace
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

Get started with the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
# Run the setup wizard (recommended for first-time users)
vibe setup

# Or launch the interactive menu
vibe
```

The setup wizard will:
1. **Discover repositories** in your workspace automatically
2. **Check installed apps** (VS Code, Warp, iTerm2, WezTerm, Cursor, Windsurf)
3. **Configure default app** for opening repositories

After setup, use these essential commands:
```bash
vibe launch 1              # Quick launch recent repository
vibe go <github-url>       # Clone, configure, and open in one command
vibe                       # Interactive menu with smart actions
```

For detailed getting started guide, see [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICK_START.md).

## Supported Applications

- **[Warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/)** - Modern terminal with AI features and collaborative tools
- **[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)** - Feature-rich terminal emulator for macOS
- **[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)** - GPU-accelerated cross-platform terminal
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - Popular code editor with extensive plugin ecosystem
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)** - AI-first code editor with built-in AI assistance and chat
- **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** - Agentic IDE powered by AI Flow paradigm

For detailed app configuration, templates, and additional developer tools, see [App Integration Guide](docs/APPS.md).

## Configuration

Vibe stores its configuration and data in `~/.toolprint/vibe-workspace/`:

```
~/.toolprint/vibe-workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml          # Main workspace configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.json           # User preferences and recent repositories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/           # App-specific templates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ warp/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ iterm2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wezterm/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vscode/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ windsurf/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/               # Performance caches
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories.db  # Repository metadata cache
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ git_status.db   # Git status cache
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backups/            # Configuration backups
```

**Key Configuration Files:**
- `config.yaml` - Repository definitions, app settings, and workspace configuration
- `state.json` - Recent repositories, user preferences, and setup completion status
- `templates/` - Customizable templates for how apps open repositories

Use these commands to manage configuration:
```bash
vibe config show           # View current configuration
vibe config edit           # Edit configuration file
vibe config backup         # Create backup archive
vibe config reset          # Factory reset (with confirmation)
```

## MCP Integration

vibe-workspace includes built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server capabilities for AI integration.

### Claude Code Integration

After installing the vibe-workspace binary on your system, you can add it to Claude Code with:

```bash
claude mcp add -s user -t stdio vibe vibe mcp
```

For detailed MCP configuration and capabilities, see [MCP Documentation](docs/MCP.md).

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized for size)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Architecture

The project is organized into modular components:

- `apps/` - Application integrations (Warp, iTerm2, VS Code, WezTerm, Cursor, Windsurf) and installer
- `cache/` - Performance caching system (repository metadata, git status)
- `git/` - Git operations (clone, search, status) and provider integrations
- `mcp/` - Model Context Protocol server for AI integration
- `ui/` - Terminal UI components (prompts, menus, workflows, smart actions)
- `uri/` - URI scheme handling for deep linking
- `utils/` - Shared utilities (filesystem, git, platform detection)
- `workspace/` - Core workspace management (config, discovery, operations)
